    HELLO WORLD
  </h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Pedro and I'm a professional Developer.
    <br><br>
    I was introduced to computers at a young age. Since I was around 8 years old I have had a computer at my home.
    <br><br>
    I grew around computers.
    <br><br>
    But only when I reached college I was introduced to computer programming.
    <br><br>
    Something clicked for me. But I would ignore it for most of my twenties.
    <br><br>
    Around the age of 26 I was reintroduced to computer programming in the form of a game engine.

    <br><br>
    <b style="font-size:1.3em;">The Unity Engine</b>
    <br><br>

    I fondly remember relearning all the basic concepts. And the joy of understanding new concepts was amazing.
    <br><br>
    After this reunion it was all uphill.
    <br><br>
    I learned all the basics of creating a computer game. From coding the gameplay, to designing levels, creating 3D models and soundtracks.
    <br><br>
    I was obsessed with it for a while.
    <br><br>
    But now I'm here. I ended up pretty much dabbling in every corner of the coding world.      <br><br>
    I might be considered a jack of all trades but master of none. But what I do have is love for the craft and a desire to expand my horizons.      <br><br>
    Since I have no formal degree I might not be able to collaborate with a lot of people, but as a service I might provide affordable solutions for most problems.
  </p>
