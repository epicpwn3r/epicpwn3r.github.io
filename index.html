    HELLO WORLD

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

      Hi, my name is Pedro and I'm a professional Developer.
        <br><br>
        I was introduced to computers at a young age. Since I was around 8 years old I have had a computer at my home.
        <br><br>
        I grew around computers.
        <br><br>
        But only when I reached college I was introduced to computer programming.
        <br><br>
        Something clicked for me. But I would ignore it for most of my twenties.
        <br><br>
        Around the age of 26 I was reintroduced to computer programming in the form of a game engine.

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      I fondly remember relearning all the basic concepts. And the joy of understanding new concepts was amazing.
      <br><br>
      After this reunion it was all uphill.
      <br><br>
      I learned all the basics of creating a computer game. From coding the gameplay, to designing levels, creating 3D models and soundtracks.
      <br><br>
      I was obsessed with it for a while.
      <br><br>
      But now I'm here. I ended up pretty much dabbling in every corner of the coding world.      <br><br>
      I might be considered a jack of all trades but master of none. But what I do have is love for the craft and a desire to expand my horizons.      <br><br>
      Since I have no formal degree I might not be able to collaborate with a lot of people, but as a service I might provide affordable solutions for most problems.
